Loads data from file into activities hash table
Lets the user interact with the table. Such as 
displaying all, displaying by location, searching
by location, and removing by location. (All locations are
Case Sensitive)

This is just a simple program testing out hash tables 
and making my own from the ground up. 

Enjoy!!!
